# Inviting and Joining

&nbsp;

Once you and your partner have both signed up and chosen your display names, you will need to “pair” your apps. 

Each user will receive a unique pairing code upon sign up, **but only one code is needed to pair**. Share one of your codes with your partner, and Honeydo will synchronize your accounts. Afterwards, you will be redirected to the main tasks page.
