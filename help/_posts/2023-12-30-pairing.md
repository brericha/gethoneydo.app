# Inviting and Joining

&nbsp;

Once you and your partner have both signed up and chosen your display names you will need to "pair" your apps. Each of you will get an invite code that Honeydo uses to connect your accounts. **Only one partner needs to enter the invite code of the other.** Afterwards Honeydo will automatically naviate to the home page.
