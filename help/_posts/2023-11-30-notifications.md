# Notifications

&nbsp;

Honeydo can send you notifications when your partner adds a new task for you and when a task is due soon.

&nbsp;

## New Tasks

----

#### Android

After granting Honeydo permission to send notifications (on Android 13 and later) this is enabled by default. Toggle the switch on the "New Task" setting to enable or disable these notifications.

#### iOS

iOS does not allow for a push notification to be cancelled once sent. If you do not wish to receive new task notifications either do not allow Honeydo permission to send notifications, or, if already allowed, remove the permission by going to System Settings &gt; Honeydo &gt; Notifications and toggling the Allow Notifications setting.

&nbsp;

## Due Soon Reminder

----

After granting Honeydo permission to send notifications (Android 13 and later, iOS) this is enabled by default. Toggle the switch on the "Due Soon Reminder" setting to enable or disable these notifications. Reminder notifications will be send around 8 hours before the task's due date. Reminder notifications are updated and set when the app opens, so if your partner adds a task and you do not open Honeydo before that task is almost due you will not receive a notification.
